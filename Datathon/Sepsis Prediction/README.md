### Description

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the bodyâ€™s response to an infection injures its own tissues and organs. According to recent estimates, one in eighteen deaths in Canada involves sepsis, making it the 12th leading cause of death nationally. Globally, sepsis affects an estimated 18 million people each year. The condition remains a leading cause of death in the Global South.

Data used for this datathon is sourced from ICU patients in three separate hospital systems and it is published by PhysioNet, managed by the MIT Laboratory for Computational Physiology. The dataset contains the data from two hospital systems. Available patient co-variates consist of Demographics, Vital Signs, and Laboratory values, which are defined in the tables below. This dataset was published to explore different techniques of Early Prediction of Sepsis from Clinical Data.

Giving appropriate treatment to patients with sepsis as soon as possible is important, but also the early prediction of sepsis is critical for treating life-threatening conditions as well. The early detection and diagnosis of sepsis can increase the likelihood of survival for patients with sepsis. Critical-care decision makers can use our findings as a reference for diagnosing sepsis ahead of time so that patients can receive the proper treatment at the right time.
