### Description

Food and waterborne infections are caused by eating or drinking contaminated food or beverages, swimming in contaminated water, or close contact with a patient or infected animal. Symptoms are typically gastrointestinal, such as diarrhea and stomach cramps. Although hospitalizations and deaths are rare, certain groups (such as pregnant females, young children, and elderly) are at increased risk of developing serious complications. Public health surveillance for food and waterborne disease outbreaks provides insight into the effectiveness of regulations and control measures, helps identify new and emerging pathogens, as well as informs regulations and public awareness activities to promote safe food handling, healthy swimming, and safe drinking water.

The provided dataset was modified using a combination of R, Python, and Tableau Prep. The dataset for this datathon was collected by the CDC through the National Outbreak Reporting System. It includes data on foodborne and waterborne disease outbreaks reported by all U.S. states and territories from 1971 to 2018. Data fields include date, US state, primary mode of transmission, causative organism, number of illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths from the outbreak, as well as specific food/water type/animal.

Health and food industry professionals can use our findings to target innovative prevention efforts related to pathogens and foods that cause waterborne and foodborne disease outbreaks.
