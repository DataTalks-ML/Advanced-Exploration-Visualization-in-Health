### Description

This is the first datathon for an advanced visualization course at the University of Calgary. The main goal of this datathon is to analyze and visualize any (of all) of the provided dataset in a creative and insightful way. We looked at how the ability to handle stress vary by province and the main cause of stress for both males and females in each province across all age groups. The dataset for this datathon were collected by Statistics Canada and present the mental health status of Canadians on both illness and positive mental health continuums by age group and sex. The importance of mental health is relevant in every stage of life - from childhood through to adulthood. It includes emotional and psychological well-being; it can also affect how stress is managed and choices are made. A decision-maker at Health Canada can use this information to connect with community groups to identify the main stressors that Canadians face daily and to help Canadians maintain and improve their mental health by designing stress-reducing intervention of programs.
