### Description

For this datathon, the challenge is to explore and explain the data collected from research papers that have been published from 2005 to 2020 on Social Media Analysis for Public Health.
Digital platforms include search engines and social media. More than half of the world are using online platforms, and every day, the number of online platform users increases. People share health information on online platforms, which became the first source of information for many people. Therefore, digital data have been a popular subject in public health surveillance studies. Our main interest is to observe different platforms that researchers used for data collection and investigate the issues examined globally. Research on these issues may reflect the differences in the burden of health issues around the world.

This dataset has been collected manually by Zahra Shakeri from DIH Lab, University of Calgary. The dataset contains temporal, geo-spatial, categorical (and binary), textual, hierarchical, and numerical types and can be used to explore the on-going research and projects on the application of social media for public health surveillance.

The number of scientific publications on public health increases every year, as well as social platform usage. Since online users share various information related to health on digital platforms, health care professionals can use the information to engage with the public to promote and educate health behaviours and create innovative health care policies and programs.
