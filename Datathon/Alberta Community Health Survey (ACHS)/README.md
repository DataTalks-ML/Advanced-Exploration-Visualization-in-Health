### Description

In 2014, Alberta was the beginning of an economic recession in the province. Between January and December 2014 more than 20,000 Albertans lost their jobs in a declining provincial economy. By 2019, this number would be more than 100,000. We explored the data collected from the ACHS and visualized the provided datasets in a creative and insightful way. We discovered the main stressor for Albertans, their ability to handle stress, and overall life satisfaction.

The Alberta Survey program is a telephone conducted survey of Albertans, to collect data on specific determinants of health to support the creation of material and social deprivation indices and assess their effects on health.

Health care professionals can use this information to engage with the public to identify the main stressors that Albertans face daily, educate health behaviours, and to create stress-reducing intervention or programs to improve Albertanâ€™s health. They can also be more informed about the impact that different life events have on individuals and use that information to proactively address and prevent negative health consequences that these events can cause. In a time of recession, these impacts could, in the worse cases, mirror those of an epidemic.
