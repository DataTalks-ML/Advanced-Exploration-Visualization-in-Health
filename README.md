# Advanced-Exploration-Visualization-in-Health

### Datathon Description
The main goal of Datathon is to analyze and visualize any (or all) of the provided dataset in a creative and insightful way.

1. A Low-fidelity Prototype

The first session (phase) of this Datathon is a working session in which students collaborate to turn the provided dataset into insight. Teams need to develop research questions and [preliminary] findings.

What is a low-fidelity prototype?

These include mock-ups quickly sketched on paper or a whiteboard with impressions of what the data might look like, and fast, digital mock-ups that may include some controls for explaining interaction ideas, such as slide jumps in PowerPoint or Keynote.

Lo-fi digital mock-ups can also incorporate charts generated in a tool like Excel or Tableau with fake or sampled data to explore possible visualization representation ideas. These lo-fi prototypes are great for communicating the gist of an idea in an interview, or for recording high-level ideas when planning out how to explore the data. Lo-fi prototypes are, by nature, fast and easy to produce. Communicating ideas with lo-fi prototypes can rapidly help establish whether the visualization designer is on the same page as the stakeholders.

2. A High-fidelity Prototype in the form of Narrative Visualization

The second phase is to develop a narrative Tableau presentation (3 minutes and up to 5 visual components). The presentation should include meaningful visualizations and text.

3. A Written Report

The report must describes the steps taken to answer their proposed question or promt. At minimum, the report must include the question being answered, findings and visualizations, and a conclusion.
